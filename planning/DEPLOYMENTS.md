# Deployment & rollback ledger

Lightweight release traceability for 46 Advance (WS-M / forensic-remediation Phase 3). This
records **what shipped, from which commit, and how to roll it back**. It is not automation —
it is the human-readable record that complements the machine release identifier.

## Release identifier (every build)

Every production build exposes a source commit/release id:

- `pwa/vite.config.ts` resolves `APP_RELEASE` from `VITE_APP_RELEASE` if set, else the short git
  SHA (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`), else `dev`.
- It is defined into the bundle as `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_RELEASE` and read by
  `src/lib/sentry.ts` as the Sentry `release`, so every captured event correlates to the exact
  build. Source-map upload uses the same `release.name` (inert until the Sentry token is set).

To identify a running build: check the Sentry release, or the `VITE_APP_RELEASE` value baked at
build time.

## Deploy targets and who deploys them

| Target | How | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hosting (PWA client)** | Owner-operated `production-deploy.yml` workflow only | Owner — **agents never deploy Hosting** |
| **Cloud Functions** | `pwa/scripts/cli/firebase-safe.sh deploy --only functions` after the secret health check + explicit confirmation | Owner or authorized agent |
| **Firestore/Storage rules** | `firebase-safe.sh deploy --only firestore:rules` (or `storage`) after rules tests + explicit confirmation | Owner or authorized agent |

Backend deploys log in as the Firebase owner account (`jared@yourstagemanager.com`). Restrictive
rules that depend on a live client follow the gated order in the remediation plan
(`archive/fix/FORENSIC_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` § Cross-cutting rule 7): additive Function → verified
Hosting release → restrictive rules.

## Rollback

- **Hosting:** re-run the owner Hosting workflow from the previous good commit (or use the
  Firebase Hosting release-rollback in the console). The PWA's stale-chunk recovery
  (`src/lib/pwa/recovery.ts`) self-heals clients holding old dynamically-imported chunks.
- **Functions:** redeploy from the previous good commit (`git checkout <sha> -- pwa/functions`
  then deploy, or deploy the whole prior commit). Functions are designed idempotent, so a
  redeploy is safe.
- **Rules:** rules are versioned in git; redeploy the previous `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules`.
  Prefer widening (permissive) rollbacks — never leave data more exposed than intended.

## Ledger

Newest first. Record backend deploys and Hosting checkpoints here. Client-only PRs ship on the
next Hosting release; note the Hosting checkpoint that carried them once known.

**Hosting live state (verified 2026-07-24).** Owner workflow run `30055170800` deployed `main` at
`d6c60c5`. It carries the quick-wins client changes — Drive import/picker errors (#178), the
Packet-filename admin control (#179), the upload-orphan guard (#181) — and the CSP `report-uri`
header (#180). Verified live: both `advancethat.web.app` and `46advance.com` serve
`content-security-policy-report-only` ending in `report-uri …/cspReport`, plus HSTS + nosniff.
(Prior checkpoint: run `30042323489` at `f0e45ea` (#174), the remediation client release.)

Both `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` are provisioned. Owner-provided Sentry evidence
confirmed the safe Admin → Observability diagnostic reached production Issues with a release tag and
a readable source-mapped frame (`ObservabilityDiagnostics.tsx:17:18`).

### CSP: report-only → enforce (open thread)

Reporting went live with the 2026-07-24 Hosting release; violations now POST to the `cspReport`
function and land in Cloud Logging.

**PREREQUISITE — #185 must ride a Hosting deploy before enforcing.** The Tier 1/2 observation found
exactly one gap: the app's Cloud Functions callables (`…cloudfunctions.net/*`) were missing from
`connect-src`. The fix (PR #185, merged to `main` 2026-07-24) is **not yet live** — the deployed
policy (last Hosting run `30106260627`, `d2e3c22`) still lacks it. It must ride a Hosting deploy
**before** the enforce flip; enforcing without it would block every callable (sign-in claims sync,
Drive, packets, admin). Until #185 is live, expect a steady `cloudfunctions.net` violation in the
logs — that's the known, already-fixed one; a genuinely clean window can only be judged after it deploys.

**Observe before enforcing** — review collected reports with:

```bash
pwa/scripts/cli/gcloud-safe.sh logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="cspreport" AND jsonPayload.message="CSP violation"' \
  --limit=100 --freshness=7d \
  --format="value(timestamp,jsonPayload.violatedDirective,jsonPayload.blockedUri,jsonPayload.documentUri)"
```

Exercise every Google/Firebase flow (Drive picker + import, Meet/Calendar, packet generate + save
to Drive, uploads, sign-in) during the window. Any violation from a *legitimate* resource means the
allowlist needs that origin added **before** enforcing — otherwise enforcing will break that feature.

When the window is clean: in `pwa/firebase.json` rename the header key
`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` → `Content-Security-Policy` (value unchanged), then run the
owner Hosting deploy. Rollback is the reverse rename + redeploy. Note `script-src` still carries
`'unsafe-inline'`, so enforcing blocks unexpected external scripts/objects/base-uri/framing but is
not full XSS protection; tightening to nonce/hash-based inline scripts is a separate effort.
